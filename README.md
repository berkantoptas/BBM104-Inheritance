#2. Software Using Documentation
##2.1. Software Usage
Program starts Main.java class.The input files given as an argument. Personnel.txt file is the first argument and the Monitoring.txt file is second.(args[0]=Personnel.txt and args[1]=Monitoring.txt)

In this experiment I am expected to develop a system to monitorize payroll of Personnel who is working in a governmental institution.
###3.1.2. Solution
I solved the problem when I read the given article at Appendix A.
##3.2. System Chart
Inputs : Personnel.txt

: personnel.java
: monitoring.java
: manager.java
: officer.java
: security.java
: employee.java
: ptemployee.java

: worker.java
: chief.java
##3.3. Algorithm
1. Program takes 2 arguments. (args[0],args[1])
2. Call readFile function with arguments.
3. Split that files and give into ArrayLists.
